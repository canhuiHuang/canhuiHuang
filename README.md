 ### Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Canhui, I am a programmer & developer. I spend the day programming & learning new technologies.

Computer Science background, my first programming language was C++. I used it for all my university projects. The things that I enjoy the most in the world of computer science are algorithms & problem solving. There is nothing more satisfatory than presenting an elegant solution to a problem, or somehow managing to make a function or algorithm to have a time complexity of from O(n) to O(1)ðŸ‘€. I acquired a lot of knowledge on Python, C#, Unity, Dart, mySQL, Flutter, & Javascript by working on personal projects.
Currently, I'm very invested in web development: html,css,js (the good stuff), and I've beeing using React.js (which is my favorite framework) a lot for my personal projects.
